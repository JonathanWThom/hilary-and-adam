# Hilary and Adam Wedding Site

Little React app I built for my sister-in-law's wedding : )

### Technology

* Boostrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Hosted on Netlify, making use of [Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/).
* Uses the Tasman theme from [awsm.css](https://igoradamenko.github.io/awsm.css/index.html).

### Development

Not sure why you'd be running this... I suppose maybe you want to replace all
their info with your own? Anyway:

_Option 1:_
`yarn install` and then `yarn start`.

_Option 2:_
Install and run Docker, then just run `make`.
